# Custom-CMOS-Inverter-Design-Layout-and-Parasitic-Extraction
A VLSI project featuring a custom CMOS inverter design ($W_p = W_n = 1.4\mu m$, $L = 68nm$). Includes full custom layout, DRC/LVS verification, and post-layout parasitic extraction (PEX). Hspice simulation evaluates timing characteristics including 79.9ps rise and 44.5ps fall delays with a 28fF load.
